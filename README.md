# Literature Review


- add a qmd file for an overview.
- what the overview will need to cover are (not necessarily in this order):
  - general motivation: 
    1. car accidents due to cognitive impairment are a problem for all. 
    2. Some meds are available to slow cognitive decline. If cognitive impairment can be detected early, that's obviously beneficial.
  - small discussion of how cognitive impairment is evaluated in 'our' study, and which stages there are (with some equivalence)
  - relationship established in the literature between mental health and driving
  - maybe also a review of what is known about the cognitive load of driving and how different aspects of cognition are affected by cognitive impairment.
- summarize the GPS driving paper in a sentence and include it in the overview. What the sentence needs at a minimum are: 
  1. stage of cognition targeted in the response, 
  2. population (size, age, cognitive status),
  3. what data was collected,
  4. Statistical method used. 


Good leads from the GPS driving paper: AD symptomatic: 17, 18 (downloaded); preclinical AD: 19, 20, 21 (all from same group as GPS driving)
