# Proposed Thesis Chapter Outlines

## Chapter 0: Literature Review & Problem Statement

This chapter presents an overview of the data sources used in this project and the challenges uncovered in their use. Spatiotemporal transportation data are discussed, and an overview of GPS and related quality measures are presented. Prior work on the map-matching problem is discussed. The new contributions of the work are explained.

## Chapter 1: Software Tools for Large-Scale Spatiotemporal Transportation Data

This chapter discusses software tools developed for visualizing large-scale spatiotemporal transportation data and explains how insights based on the visualizations led to subsequent work.

## Chapter 2: Detecting Driving Behavior from Large-Scale Spatiotemporal Transportation Data

This chapter explains how driving behavior may be detected from telematics data. An application to cognitive health in older drivers is presented.

## Chapter 3: Determining Precise Vehicle Locations on the Road System

This chapter covers a new method for determining a vehicle's location on a road segment after a map-matching algorithm is used. An application using this method is discussed.

# Timeline of Tasks to Complete

## Rest of October/November 2025

* Meet with Dr. Hallmark, Guillermo, and Heike to discuss our plans for "Turns and Downturns in Aging Drivers."

* Decide how to handle the changes made to the participant demographics data used in "Turns and Downturns in Aging Drivers."

* Revise and submit the `DrivePlotR` paper for the TRB program. (This paper will be incorporated into Chapter 1 of my thesis.)

* Start making slides for my TRB presentation about `DrivePlotR`.

* Further develop my position-determination method for map-matching, which will be in Chapter 3 of my thesis.

# December 2025

* Finish slides and practice TRB presentation about `DrivePlotR` at Graphics Group.

* Update "Turns and Downturns in Aging Drivers" in preparation for submission.

* Choose a target application for Chapter 3 of my thesis.

* Start writing about the background of the application for the position-determination method in Chapter 3.

* Continue to develop my position-determination method for map-matching, which will be in Chapter 3 of my thesis.

# January 2026

* Present about `DrivePlotR` at the TRB Annual Meeting.

* Account for any presentation feedback `DrivePlotR` and the associated paper, which will be included in Chapter 1 of my thesis.
