# Proposed Thesis Chapter Outlines and Timelines

## Chapter 0: Literature Review & Problem Statement

This chapter presents an overview of the data sources used in this project and the challenges uncovered in their use. Spatiotemporal transportation data are discussed, and an overview of GPS and related quality measures are presented. Prior work on the map-matching problem is discussed. The new contributions of the work are explained.

### Timeline

* Submit full draft of Chapter 0 to major professors: May 2026.

* Address comments as necessary.

## Chapter 1: Software Tools for Large-Scale Spatiotemporal Transportation Data

This chapter discusses software tools developed for visualizing large-scale spatiotemporal transportation data (including my R package `DrivePlotR`) and explains how insights based on the visualizations led to subsequent work.

### Timeline

* Submit a revised draft of the `DrivePlotR` paper to co-authors: November 2025.

* Address comments from co-authors about the `DrivePlotR` paper: November 2025.

* Submit a revised draft of the `DrivePlotR` paper to appear in the Transportation Research Board (TRB) Annual Meeting online program: November 2025.

* Address any comments received after TRB presentation: January 2026.

* Submit an improved draft of the `DrivePlotR` paper to co-authors: February 2026.

* Submit a draft of the `DrivePlotR` paper to a peer-reviewed journal: March 2026.

* Address reviewer comments as necessary.

## Chapter 2: Detecting Driving Behavior from Large-Scale Spatiotemporal Transportation Data

This chapter explains how driving behavior may be detected from telematics data. An application to cognitive health in older drivers is presented. (This chapter will include the paper "Turns and Downturns in Aging Drivers.")

### Timeline

* Submit an updated draft of "Turns and Downturns in Aging Drivers" to co-authors: November 2025.

* Submit a draft of "Turns and Downturns in Aging Drivers" to a peer-reviewed journal: December 2025.

* Address reviewer comments as necessary.

## Chapter 3: Determining Precise Vehicle Locations on the Road System

This chapter covers a new method for determining a vehicle's location on a road segment after a map-matching algorithm is used. An application using this method is discussed.

### Timeline

* Submit a draft of the paper about my map-matching position determination method to co-authors: June 2026.

* Submit a draft of the paper about my map-matching position determination method to a peer-reviewed journal: June/July 2026.

* Address reviewer comments as necessary.

## Related Presentation: `DrivePlotR` at the Annual Meeting of the Transportation Research Board (TRB) in January 2026

### Timeline

* Submit a revised draft of the `DrivePlotR` paper to co-authors: November 2025.

* Address comments from co-authors about the `DrivePlotR` paper: November 2025.

* Submit a revised draft of the `DrivePlotR` paper to appear in the TRB online program: November 2025.

* Submit my TRB poster for review by co-authors: December 2025.

* Submit my TRB poster to appear in the conference program: December 2025.

* Present my poster at TRB: January 2026.

* Address any comments received after my TRB presentation: January 2026.
