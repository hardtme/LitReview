* @bayatGPSDrivingDigital2021: "GPS driving: a digital biomarker for preclinical Alzheimer disease"

  - When included as features in a random forest model, driving behaviors such as the average number of jerks and the number of trips made at night can be used to predict preclinical Alzheimer's disease in 139 adults from the St. Louis, Missouri, metropolitan area who were age 65 or older and had normal cognition at the time of study enrollment.

  - Preclinical AD: people have evidence of AD pathology but no clinical symptoms
  
* @davisEvaluationNaturalisticDriving2020: "Evaluation of naturalistic driving behavior using in-vehicle monitoring technology in preclinical and early Alzheimer's disease"

  - For a convenience sample of older drivers with symptomatic AD, older drivers with preclinical AD, and cognitively normal older drivers whose driving was monitored with GPS data logging (all participants) and video recording (participants with symptomatic AD) for 3 months, Spearman correlations ($\rho$) showed a strong association between speeding and collisions/near collisions in the symptomatic AD participants. In a Poisson regression model, performance on a psychomotor task (Trails A) was a significant predictor of the number of adverse driving events (hard braking, sudden acceleration, and speeding).
