The first one provides the user with a map and the ability to search the map in a variety of ways; the second provides both a map and the user's current location; and the third provides a map, the user's location, and directions of some kind. The paper then explores map-matching algorithms that can be used to reconcile inaccurate locational data with an inaccurate map/network. Point-to-point, point-to-curve, and curve-to-curve matching is discussed, and in all three cases algorithms that only use geometric information and that also use topological information are considered.},

Although it has been an active topic for more than two decades and, driven by the emerging applications, is still under development. There is a lack of categorisation of existing solutions recently and analysis for future research directions. In this paper, we review the current status of the map-matching problem and survey the existing algorithms. We propose a new categorisation of the solutions according to their map-matching models and working scenarios. In addition, we experimentally compare three representative methods from different categories to reveal how matching model affects the performance. Besides, the experiments are conducted on multiple real datasets with different settings to demonstrate the influence of other factors in map-matching problem, like the trajectory quality, data compression and matching latency.},

  abstract = {The increasing use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in safety-critical missions in both civilian and military areas demands accurate and reliable navigation, where one of the key sources of navigation information is presented by Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). In challenging conditions, for example, in urban areas, the accuracy of GNSS-based navigation may degrade significantly due to user-satellite geometry and obscuration issues without being noticed by the user. Therefore, considering the essentially dynamic rate of change in this type of environment, integrity monitoring is of critical importance for understanding the level of trust we have in positioning and timing data. In this paper, the dilution of precision (DOP) coefficients under nominal and challenging conditions were investigated for the purpose of integrity monitoring in urban environments. By analyzing positioning information in a simulated urban environment using a software-based GNSS receiver, the integrity monitoring approach based on joint consideration of GNSS observables and environmental parameters has been proposed. It was shown that DOP coefficients, when considered together with a number of visible satellites and cut-off elevations specific to the urban environment carry valuable integrity information that is difficult to get using existing integrity monitoring approaches. This has allowed generating indirect integrity measures based on cut-off elevation and satellite visibility that can be used for UAV path planning and guidance in urban environments.},

  abstract = {Background As an important indicator of mobility, driving confers a host of social and health benefits to older adults. Despite the importance of safe mobility as the population ages, longitudinal data are lacking about the natural history and determinants of driving safety in older adults. Methods The Longitudinal Research on Aging Drivers (LongROAD) project is a multisite prospective cohort study designed to generate empirical data for understanding the role of medical, behavioral, environmental and technological factors in driving safety during the process of aging. Results A total of 2990 active drivers aged 65--79~years at baseline have been recruited through primary care clinics or health care systems in five study sites located in California, Colorado, Maryland, Michigan, and New York. Consented participants were assessed at baseline with standardized research protocols and instruments, including vehicle inspection, functional performance tests, and ``brown-bag review'' of medications. The primary vehicle of each participant was instrumented with a small data collection device that records detailed driving data whenever the vehicle is operating and detects when a participant is driving. Annual follow-up is being conducted for up to three years with a telephone questionnaire at 12 and 36~months and in-person assessment at 24~months. Medical records are reviewed annually to collect information on clinical diagnoses and healthcare utilization. Driving records, including crashes and violations, are collected annually from state motor vehicle departments. Pilot testing was conducted on 56 volunteers during March--May 2015. Recruitment and enrollment were completed between July 2015 and March 2017. Conclusions Results of the LongROAD project will generate much-needed evidence for formulating public policy and developing intervention programs to maintain safe mobility while ensuring well-being for older adults.},

This paper describes a novel, principled map matching algorithm that uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to find the most likely road route represented by a time-stamped sequence of latitude/longitude pairs. The HMM elegantly accounts for measurement noise and the layout of the road network. We test our algorithm on ground truth data collected from a GPS receiver in a vehicle. Our test shows how the algorithm breaks down as the sampling rate of the GPS is reduced. We also test the effect of increasing amounts of additional measurement noise in order to assess how well our algorithm could deal with the inaccuracies of other location measurement systems, such as those based on WiFi and cell tower multilateration. We provide our GPS data and road network representation as a standard test set for other researchers to use in their map matching work.},

We investigate an open-source alternative for map-matching trajectories called Valhalla, which could replace limited and costly commercial map-matching services. Valhalla is an open-source routing engine, which provides different services, such as path-finding, map-matching, and generating maneuvers based on a path. We build a cloud-based big data analytics framework on Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform for map-matching. This well-established framework is scalable and could process millions of trajectories. Using an example GPS dataset, it is demonstrated how Valhalla can be used for map-matching at scale. The dataset consists of about 18 million trips in the year 2019 that have at least one recorded point in a bounding box surrounding Frankfurt am Main. The map-matching results confirm an adequate performance of Valhalla map-matching, show a reduction of errors by distance calculation, and allow for further street-segment-based analysis.},

The accuracy of the map-aided estimates is derived for an arbitrary positioning system with Gaussian measurement noise demonstrating significant improvements over the raw measurements. Further performance improvements are achieved through the use of a 1D Kalman filter developed to utilise the fact that all of the map-aided position estimates lie along known curves. The mathematical framework utilised by the map-aided estimator readily allows other sources of position information such as road type and road rules to be quantified and optimally incorporated into the estimation process.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {A novel method of map matching using the Global Positioning System (GPS) has been developed for civilian use, which uses digital mapping data to infer the systematic position errors of less than 100m which result largely from `selective availability' (S/A) imposed by the US military. Selective availability was switched off on the 2nd of May 2000, and is to be replaced with `regional denial capabilities in lieu of global degradation'. The system tracks a vehicle on all possible roads (road centre-lines) in a computed error region, then uses a method of rapidly detecting inappropriate road centre-lines from the set of all those possible. This is called the Road Reduction Filter (RRF) algorithm. Point positioning is computed using C/A code pseudorange measurements direct from a GPS receiver. The least squares estimation is performed in the software developed for the experiment described in this paper. Virtual differential GPS (VDGPS) corrections are computed and used from a vehicle's previous positions, thus providing an autonomous alternative to DGPS for in-car navigation and fleet management. Height aiding is used to augment the solution and reduce the number of satellites required for a position solution. Ordnance Survey (OS) digital map data was used for the experiment, i.e. OSCAR 1 m resolution road centre-line geometry and Land Form PANORAMA 1:50,000, 50 m-grid digital terrain model (DTM). Testing of the algorithm is reported and results are analysed. Vehicle positions provided by RRF are compared with the `true' position determined using high precision (cm) GPS carrier phase techniques. It is shown that height aiding using a DTM and the RRF significantly improve the accuracy of position provided by inexpensive single frequency GPS receivers.},
