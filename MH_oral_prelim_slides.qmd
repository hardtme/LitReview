# Telematics Data

## Sources

* Naturalistic driving studies (NDS)

* Connected vehicles

## Data Structure

Spatiotemporal data recorded every 1 to 3 seconds

* Location (latitude/longitude)

* Time

## Use Cases

* Studying driving behavior

* Driving maneuver detection

* Work zone influence/performance

* Etc.

## Issues

* GPS drift/GPS errors

* Large data volume

* Low CV data coverage at certain times

* Etc.

# GPS Data

## Overview

* How GPS works

* Relationship between satellites and receiver

## Dilution of Precision

* Measure of GPS data quality

* Different types

## Issues

* Poor GPS signal

* Low DOP doesn't always mean good quality GPS data

* Etc.

# Map Matching

## Main Questions

1. Which road segment is the vehicle using?

2. Where exactly on the road segment is the vehicle?

## Existing Map Matching Methods

* Naive methods

* More advanced naive methods

* Hidden Markov models

* Etc.

## Map Matching Challenges

* True path is usually unknown

* Error quantification

* Outlier sensitivity

* Etc.

# Areas of Interest

## Visualizing Telematics Data

* Relating location in time and space to other variables 

* R package `DrivePlotR`

## Processing Telematics Data

* Map matching

* Correctly locating telematics data in space (latitude/longitude on correct part of the road system) and time

## Drawing Insights from Telematics Data

For example,

* Developing driving biomarkers for age-related cognitive decline in senior citizens

* Deriving the time to complete turning maneuvers at intersections

* Quantifying the influence of work zones, crashes, etc. on traffic flow
