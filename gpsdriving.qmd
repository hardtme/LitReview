# Introduction

* Evidence that cognitive changes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) impact behaviors like driving

* "Drivers with symptomatic AD are are more likely to drive shorter distances, visit fewer unique destinations, and have a smaller driving space compared to cognitively intact drivers."

* "Pre-clinical AD can be identified by evaluating driving behaviors"

* "Future research aimed at using everyday driving as a behavioral marker of AD should explore additional statistical modelling techniques to determine optimal combinations of variables"

# Methods

## Participants

Criteria for participation in the study:

1. Age 65 or older

2. Had normal cognition at a clinical assessment

3. Underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection

4. Valid driver's license

5. Drove at least once a week, on average

## CSF biomarkers and APOE genotyping

* Several biomarkers used to identify participants with pre-clinical AD

* Genetic association with developing AD

## GPS data collection

* Location: St. Louis, MO, metropolitan area

* GPS data logger installed on each participant's vehicle

* System called Driving Real-World In-Vehicle Evaluation System (DRIVES)

* Every 30 sec, DRIVES recorded

  - Date
  
  - Time
  
  - Latitude and longitude
  
  - Speed
  
* Study was one year; data available from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019

## GPS-based driving behavior measures

* Driving space indicators 

  - Average trip distance (TripDist): "The average distance traveled in each trip. TripDist is computed by taking the average of all the trips that a participant has made during the study period."
  
  - Total traveled distance (TotalDist): "The total distance traveled during the study period."
  
  - Number of trips (nTrips): "The total number of trips made during the study period. The trips are also placed into five subgroups: (1) trips with a distance smaller than 1 mi, (2) trips with a distance between 1 and 5 mi, (3) trips with a distance between 5 and 10 mi, (4) trips with a distance between 10 and 20 mi, and (4) trips with a distance of more than 20 mi."
  
  - Radius of gyration (Rg): Computed using $r_g = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i \in L} n_i(r_i-r_{cm})^2}$ where
    
    + $L$ is the set of destination visited by the participant
    
    + $r_i$ is the latitude and longitude coordinates of location $i$
    
    + $n_i$ is "the visitation frequency of location $i$"
    
    + $N= \sum n_i$ is "the total number of visits of the individual"
    
    + $r_{cm}$ is "the center of mass of the visited destinations"

  - Entropy ($S$): "The degree to which a participantâ€™s trip destinations are random (i.e. unpredictable) in space and time" (assessed over the whole study period)
  
  - Number of night trips (nNightTrip): mean number of trips made after sunset
  
  - Number of unique destinations (nUniqDest): "the total number of distinct destinations that an individual visited during the entire study period"
  
* Driving performance indicators

  - Number of hard brakes per mile (nHardBrake): "the average number of events with a deceleration rate of above 8 miles per hour in 1 s per mile"
  
  - Number of sudden accelerations per mile (nSuddenAccel): "the average number of events with an acceleration rate of above 8 miles per hour in 1 s per mile"
  
  - Overspeed (OverV): "the average number of trips with a speed of 6 miles per hour above the posted speed limit"
  
  - Underspeed (UnderV): "the average number of trips with a speed of 6 miles per hour below the posted speed limit"
  
  - Average speed (avgV): average speed of trips
  
  - Average acceleration (avgA): average acceleration of trips 
  
  - Average jerk (avgJ): "The average jerk of trips. Jerk is the rate of change of acceleration; that is, more abrupt brake actions or accelerations lead to higher jerk values."
  
## Machine learning and statistical analyses

* Binary classifier:

  - Class 0: no pre-clinical AD
  
  - Class 1: pre-clinical AD
  
* 4 random forest models:

  1. Age and APOE $\epsilon 4$ status (carrier or non-carrier)
  
  2. Driving features
  
  3. Driving features and age
  
  4. Driving features, age, and APOE $\epsilon 4$ status
  
* Predictors ranked according to RF Gini index

* Train/test split: 70%/30%

* Each month record for each participant was considered an independent data point.

* Incremental hyperparameter tuning (i.e., fit models, choose best-performing models, and tune them more)

* Compared model performances with F1 score

* Created ROC curve and computed AUC

# Results

## Sample characteristics

* No significant differences regarding sex, race, or education level

## RF models

* Best model included age, APOE $\epsilon 4$, and driving indicators

## Driving indicator performance

* Most important features:
  
  - APOE $\epsilon 4$ status
  
  - Age
  
  - Average jerk
  
  - Number of night trips
  
  - Radius of gyration
  
# Discussion/conclusion

* "[D]riving may serve as an effective and accurate digital biomarker for identifying preclinical AD among older adults."

* APOE $\epsilon 4$ testing is invasive.

* "Overall, although the model with driving behavior, age, and APOE $\epsilon 4$ status achieved the highest performance, the model with driving indicators and age alone is the highest performing non-invasive and accessible choice."

* Jerk was most important driving feature.

* Need to consider both driving performance and driving space features in the model

# Limitations

* Spouses, friends, and family members may have driven some trips instead of the study participants.

* All participants came from the St. Louis metropolitan area.

* Limited investigation into sociodemographic attributes (e.g., sex, race, income, education level, etc.)

* Repeated measures were treated as independent measures $\Rightarrow$ new research should incorporate methods that handle the correlated features from participants over time (e.g., repeated measures random forest)
